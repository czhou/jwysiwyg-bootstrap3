What is this?
-------------

This is jWYSIWYG, modified to integrate better with Bootstrap 3-based pages. That is all.

How do I use it?
----------------

Use **jquery.wysiwyg.js** from here instead of the vanilla one. Any plugins used should also be copied
from here. Oh, don't forget to remove any reference to **jquery.wysiwyg.css**, we don't need none of that.
You're all set!

Anything else?
--------------

For documentation on jWYSIWYG, refer to the `main documentation <https://github.com/jwysiwyg/jwysiwyg>`_.
